# NumPy

NumPyâ€™s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.

1. a powerful N-dimensional array object
2. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
3. tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
4. useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

# Pandas
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
1. Library built on top of Python 
2. Open Source 
3. BSD-licensed library providing 
4. high-performance 
5. Data analysis tools for the Python programming language 
6. Excel inside Python

# Before Panda Existing
Data Munging & Preparation >> R >> Back to Python

# After that Pandas come with high-performance 
Data Munging & Preparation >> Pandas >> Back to Python

so in this case, no need to R Language because just replaced with Pandas and back to python

# Why Pandas
1. Series, Data Frame and Panel Data type 
2. I/O tools, between in memory <-> csv, excel, SQL 
3. Handling missing data 
4. Reshaping data 
5. slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting 
6. size mutability 
7. High performance merging and joining 
8. optimized for performance 
9. Hierarchical axis indexing 
10 Time series
