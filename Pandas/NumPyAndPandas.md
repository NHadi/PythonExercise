# NumPy

NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.
• a powerful N-dimensional array object
• sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
• tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
• useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

# Pandas
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
• Library built on top of Python 
• Open Source 
• BSD-licensed library providing 
• high-performance 
• Data analysis tools for the Python programming language 
• Excel inside Python

# Before Panda Existing
Data Munging & Preparation >> R >> Back to Python

# After that Pandas come with high-performance 
Data Munging & Preparation >> Pandas >> Back to Python

so in this case, no need to R Language because just replaced with Pandas and back to python

# Why Pandas
• Series, Data Frame and Panel Data type 
• I/O tools, between in memory <-> csv, excel, SQL 
• Handling missing data 
• Reshaping data 
• slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting 
• size mutability 
• High performance merging and joining 
• optimized for performance 
• Hierarchical axis indexing 
• Time series
